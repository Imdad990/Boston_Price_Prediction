This repository contains the implementation of a decision tree regression model applied to the Boston Housing dataset. The goal of this project is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston based on various features.

Key Features:

Dataset: The Boston Housing dataset, which includes information on housing values and various attributes such as crime rate, average number of rooms, etc.

Model: Decision Tree Regression algorithm is used to build the predictive model.

Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85% in predicting housing prices.


Usage Instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.


2. Install the required libraries (such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy).


3. Run the provided Python script to train the model and evaluate its performance.



Objective: The aim of this project is to demonstrate the application of decision tree regression in predicting real estate prices using the Boston Housing dataset.
